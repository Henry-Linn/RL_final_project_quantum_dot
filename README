There are no dependencies that need to be downloaded.

Instruction for running and building the code:

1. Make sure your computer has downloaded python. You can check if you have installed it or not by typing "python -version" into your terminal.
2. Open up the terminal and cd into where you unzip the final_report.zip.
3. Type "python monte_carlo.py" to run Monte Carlo simulation.
4. Type "python td_methods.py" to run SARSA simulation.
5. Type "python dynamic_programming.py" to run dynamic programming simulation.

Note: These python files will generate the plots that we used in our report.
